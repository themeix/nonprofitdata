Researchers at the Urban Institute, American University, George Mason University, and Georgia Institute of Technology have partnered to improve data about the nonprofit sector and access to those data. The collaboration is working to improve research on the sector, share what is learned with the nonprofit and research communities, and help policymakers and the public make informed decisions that affect or support nonprofit organizations.

## Survey of Nonprofit Trends and Impacts

The survey component of the project is a long-term initiative to collect longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations in the United States.  

By collecting data from a nationally representative sample of nonprofit organizations, the survey will help people better understand how changes in giving and volunteering have affected nonprofit organizations and the people and communities they serve. 

Each year of the data will be available in a public use format and a restricted use format for analysis by others. The first two waves of the survey are complete:  

**Year 1: January-April 2021**

The first wave of the survey includes a nationally representative sample of 2,306 nonprofit organizations. The survey had 35 questions about organizational characteristics (nonprofit subsector, size, and staff and board characteristics); their programs (who they serve and where they serve them); staff and volunteer numbers and demographics; donation and volunteer importance; fundraising and finances (including donation trends during 2015-2019 and 2020; and 2020 strategies to weather the public health, social, and economic change in that year.

**Year 2: January-May 2022**

The second wave of the survey was sent to **X,XXX** nonprofit organizations and included the same core questions from the first wave plus **DIFFERENT QUESTIONS**. 



## The Data Platform

The Nonprofit Organization Research Panel Project (NORPP) is funded by the National Science Foundation Human Networks and Data Science Infrastructure Program (collaborative award numbers 2024310, 2024307, 2024320, and 2024330 to [American University](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2024310&HistoricalAwards=false), George Mason University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the [Urban Institute](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2024330&HistoricalAwards=false)). 

The team is working to create a publicly accessible, internet-based, and collaborative research platform that will lower the costs of collecting and sharing high-quality, multiyear data on nonprofit organizations and their activities. The project establishes benchmarks on nonprofit management practices and performance over time.

The goal of the platform is to strengthen research and evaluation, broaden access to data-intensive research, and lead to more scientifically informed decision-making by organizations, policymakers, and funders and improved outcomes for the communities they serve.
